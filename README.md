<b>LazyRow</b> is a composable that enables you to create horizontal lists that load items on demand, improving performance by loading only visible items. It works similarly to LazyColumn (for vertical lists) but scrolls horizontally.(Used for Featured Section)

Flow Layouts like <b>FlowRow</b> and <b>FlowColumn</b> allow items to flow naturally into new rows or columns as space is filled. This is especially useful for displaying dynamic content like tags, buttons, or any list of items that might not fit on a single row or column.(Used FlowRow for Coming Soon Section)

In Jetpack Compose, <b>HorizontalPager</b> is a component from the Accompanist library that allows you to create horizontally scrollable pages, similar to a ViewPager in the traditional Android View system. Itâ€™s commonly used for image galleries, onboarding screens, or any content that benefits from a paginated layout.(Used for Recently and On Demand Section)

<b>RememberPagerState</b> - The rememberPagerState function is commonly used with HorizontalPager or VerticalPager. It initializes a PagerState object that can be modified or observed within the composable, making it possible to manage which page is currently visible and to customize pager behaviors like scrolling.
